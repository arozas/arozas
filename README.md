- 👋 `Hello World!`, I’m Alejandro Rozas from the city of Glew, in Buenos Aires, 🇦🇷 Argentina.
- 🏛️ I currently work as an administrative advisor at the National Institute of Public Administration [`INAP`](https://capacitacion.inap.gob.ar/) , an undersecretary dependent on the Head of the Cabinet of      Ministers of the Nation. I have been a public agent for 6 years, and since I entered the Argentine state I have participated in several interesting projects of different national ministries.
- 🏗️ My previous job was in the construction sector, in one of the main companies in the field where I worked for 7 years as an administrative assistant 👨‍💼.
- 🧔‍♂️ Now 37 years old I decided to change my career and enter the world of programming as a full time developer. I am very excited about this new challenge and I look forward to developing the necessary skills to enter this new world.
- 🌱 I am at the beginning of the programming and systems career at the Univerisidad Tecnológica Nacional -National Technological University-[`UTN`](http://www.sistemas-utnfra.com.ar/#/home) of Argentina
- 🌅 In my free time I like to drive my motorcycles 🏍️ and tour the interior of Buenos Aires, I also have a park with a garden where I `grow` some of my favorite vegetables and spices. I am single and I live with two non-human people, my little adventure companions, my `two poodles`, one black and one white 🐺🐻‍❄️.
- 👀 I am very interested as soon as I have the skills to participate in development projects remotely in order to improve my skills and gain new ones.
