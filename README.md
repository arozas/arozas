- 🏛️ I currently work as an administrative advisor at the National Institute of Public Administration [`INAP`](https://capacitacion.inap.gob.ar/) , an undersecretary dependent on the Head of the Cabinet of      Ministers of the Nation. I have been a public agent for 6 years, and since I entered the Argentine state I have participated in several interesting projects of different national ministries.
